        <h2>My Self</h2>
        <p>
            I pledge to always adhere to <b>Class Protocols</b>. I will Never use my  Phone for <strong>NON-Class Activities</strong>.
            I pledge to bring my Laptop to Class and Participate effectively in all Class activities. <br/> 
            I promise to follow the <u>Instructions of the Lecturer</u>, and in case I miss a step, I will quickly call the Attention of the Lecturer to help me get back on track. 
            I will not sit unconcerned during class, especially during <i><b>practical Sessions</b></i>.
        </p>
        <h2>My Friend</h2>
        <p>
            If you ever claim to be my friend, then Never disrupt me during activities. 
            Concerntrate on what the lecturer is doing so you can understand the concept being taught.
            This will help us become better students and help each other later. Class time is not for Whatsapping me.
